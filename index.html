                                called Titans, forcing humans to hide in fear behind enormous concentric walls. What makes these giants truly terrifying 
                                is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their 
                                survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single 
                                titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal Titan manages to breach the supposedly 
                                impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations. <br><br>
                                After witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their
                                eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the
                                protection of the walls. Eren, his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman, and his childhood friend Armin Arlert join the brutal

                                the realm of death gods is a humdrum, unchanging gambling den. The ingenious 17-year-old Japanese student Light Yagami
                                and sadistic god of death Ryuk share one belief: their worlds are rotten. <br><br>
                               For his own amusement, Ryuk drops his Death Note into the human world. Light stumbles upon it, deeming the first of its
                               rules ridiculous: the human whose name is written in this note shall die. However, the temptation is too great, and Light
                               experiments by writing a felon's name, which disturbingly enacts his first murder. <br><br>
                                Aware of the terrifying godlike power that has fallen into his hands, Light—under the alias Kira—follows his wicked
                                sense of justice with the ultimate goal of cleansing the world of all evil-doers. The meticulous mastermind detective
                                L is already on his trail, but as Light's brilliance rivals L's, the grand chase for Kira turns into an intense battle
                                of wits that can only end when one of them is dead.</li>

                                and Alphonse are left in a catastrophic new reality. Ignoring the alchemical principle banning human transmutation,

                            <li><strong>Summary:</strong><br> The seemingly unimpressive Saitama has a rather unique hobby: being a hero. In order
                                to pursue his childhood dream, Saitama relentlessly trained for three years, losing all of his hair in the process.
                                Now, Saitama is so powerful, he can defeat any enemy with just one punch. However, having no one capable of matching
                                his strength has led Saitama to an unexpected problem—he is no longer able to enjoy the thrill of battling and has
                                become quite bored. <br><br>
                                One day, Saitama catches the attention of 19-year-old cyborg Genos, who witnesses his power and wishes to become
                                Saitama's disciple. Genos proposes that the two join the Hero Association in order to become certified heroes that
                                will be recognized for their positive contributions to society. Saitama, who is shocked that no one knows who he is,
                                quickly agrees. Meeting new allies and taking on new foes, Saitama embarks on a new journey as a member of the Hero
                                Association to experience the excitement of battle he once felt.</li>
